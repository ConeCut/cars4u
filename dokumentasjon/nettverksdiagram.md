Explanation:

- **Windows Server (Desktop Computer):** Acts as the primary server hosting the virtualized environment. It runs Windows Server and provides the physical hardware for hosting the virtual machines.

- **Virtualization (Windows Hyper-V):** Utilizes virtualization technology (e.g., Windows Hyper-V) to create and manage virtual machines. In this case, it hosts an Ubuntu virtual machine where the cars4u website is deployed.

- **Ubuntu VM (cars4u Website):** Runs the cars4u website within an Ubuntu virtual machine environment. It serves as the primary server software for hosting the website and handles user requests and data processing.

- **Backup Storage (External Hard Drive, Cloud, etc.):** Provides storage for backup data and configurations. This could include external hard drives, cloud storage services, or other backup solutions used to store backups of critical data from the Windows Server host machine and the Ubuntu VM.

This network diagram illustrates the infrastructure setup where the Windows Server desktop computer hosts a virtualized environment, including an Ubuntu VM for hosting the cars4u website. Additionally, it highlights the importance of backup storage for ensuring data protection and redundancy within the network environment.
